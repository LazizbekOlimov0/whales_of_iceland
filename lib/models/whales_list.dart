      The Fin Whale is the second largest animal in the world! The body is long and sleek,
       and dark coloured above and white below, with a brown-toned chevron pattern behind the head. 
       The right jaw is white or pale, while the left is dark gray or black. The baleen plates are coloured accordingly.
        The tall below looks like an inverted cone. Their breathing cycle is 3-4 times before going down for a deep dive
         and they usually spend about 5-20 min underwater, diving down to 50-250 m (156-820 ft).

      A large and rather robust body that is black above and black-and-white or mottled below.
       The characteristic features are the long flippers, measuring ⅓ of the body length,
        and the fluke that has a distinctive black and white pattern on the underside. 
        The composition of the pattern distinguishes individuals and is used for identification.
         Head and flippers are covered with barnacles, which will attach soon after birth and remain during the animals lifetime.
          They can stay underwater for about 5-15 minutes.

    A very robust body with a distinctive black-and-white colour and a grey saddle patch behind the dorsal fin. 
    The head is conical and lacks a well-defined beak. The dorsal fin, situated mid-back, is large (up to 1,8 m (6 ft) in males), 
    prominent and variable in shape: curved in females and juveniles, erected and almost spike like in adult males.
     The flippers are large, broad and rounded.

    A comparably small and sleek body that is black or dark grey above and whitish underneath. 
    The head is pointed and V-shaped, with a longitudinal ridge running along the top of the head.
     The flippers are narrow with pointed tips and have a white band across, whereas the individuals living in the Southern Hemisphere usually have plain black flippers.
      The dorsal fin is falcate and used for identification. They can stay underwater for about 5-20 minutes and can dive down to 50-100 m (164-328 ft).

    The squid eating Moby Dick, or Sperm Whale is the largest of the toothed whales. 
    It has a rather wrinkled and shriveled appearance, the body is evenly dark grey with a white upper lip and white patches on the belly.
     The head measures ⅓ of the body length and is blunt and square. The dorsal fin is low and thick. 
     The flippers are short and broad, and the fluke can be 5 m (16.4 ft) wide and is triangular in shape with a straight trailing edge. 
     The single blowhole is located in the front left side of the head, creating a bushy, forward projected blow.
      The lower jaw is small and contains all the, 40-52 teeth and therefore it isn’t a baleen whale.

    about: '''
    The Blue Whale is also known as the "King of the Sea", being the largest animal on earth.
     Their body is distinctively mottled and grayish-blue in color. 
     The large blow can be seen from afar and is a clear sign of their presence.
      Occasionally they will lift the fluke before a deep dive to be able to reach higher depths. 
      The fluke can be up to 8 m (26 ft) in diameter. Their breathing cycle is 3-4 times before going down for 
      a deep dive and they usually spend about 10-30 min underwater, diving down to about 50-100 m (164-328 ft).
       They live solitary or in small groups, and travel occasionally in association with fin whales. 
       Possessing the loudest voice in the animal kingdom, they emit low-frequency sounds that travel hundreds 
       of kilometers under water and can reach 188 decibels. Sometimes they crossbreed with fin or humpback whales.

    Sei Whales are the fastest swimmers! They have a large, sleek body that is grey on top and white or cream-coloured below.
     Oval scars often cover the body. A single longitudinal ridge forms the midline on top of the head.
      The flippers are relatively short and pointed, and the fluke comparably small. 
      Together with the fin whales, they probably are the fastest swimmers of the large whales, capable of speeds up to 45 km/h. 
      They usually stay underwater for 5-20 minutes but it doesn’t dive very deep. They live solitary or in small groups of 2 - 3 individuals.
